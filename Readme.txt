Website Portfolio built with Bootstrap 5
was created by Moses Ekpenisi

aos animate lib for animation on the Website

NOTE: I created this basic Portfolio website for the Coding School WÃ¶rthersee projects 1
i made its simple with little animation keeping the projects instructions in check,
i used Bootstrap 5 to keep the css simple and to save me time and less css writing
and i also added a aos animate lib for some cool animations when scrolling down or up.
the portfolio is not complete yet like the projects links  but it will be soon,
some links i didnt use ,over all site is still on going.


thank you for your support.
